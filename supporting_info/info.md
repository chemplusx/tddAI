### Researches and software developed for synthesis planning by ML

Recent advancements in ML have significantly impacted the field of synthesis planning in
chemistry, which have led to the development of sophisticated software tools. These tools are
designed to assist chemists in mapping out the most efficient and feasible pathways for
synthesising complex molecules. By utilising algorithms that can process vast datasets and
identify patterns and relationships within chemical structures and reactions, these software
programs significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of synthesis planning.
Moreover, the development of synthesis-planning programs increasingly relies on a
combination of human insight and machine learning. This hybrid approach leverages the
strengths of both human expertise in chemistry and the computational power of ML
algorithms. Such programs aim to replicate the decision-making process of synthetic
chemists, thereby facilitating more efficient and innovative approaches to chemical synthesis.
These advancements reflect a broader trend in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries,
where high-throughput experimentation and data-driven methods are revolutionising
traditional practices. There are many software and tools developed for synthesis planning (table1.csv)[]
